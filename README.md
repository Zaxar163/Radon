## Radon 2.0 will no longer be maintained - it will be replaced by Radon 3.0

Radon is a Java bytecode obfuscator that I conceptualized in my freshman year
of high school. I use Radon to experiment with obfuscation and to learn various
parts of Java bytecode.

Check the [wiki for usage](https://github.com/ItzSomebody/Radon/wiki) or maybe
even the [Discord](https://discord.gg/RfuxTea).

This project is **not** likely to be production-safe nor bug free. If you would
like some pointers to production-safe (more or less) and less buggy Java
bytecode obfuscators, I would suggest one of these:
* [Paramorphism](https://paramorphism.serenity.enterprises/) -
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/k9DPvEy)
* [Proguard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard)
* [Zelix KlassMaster](http://www.zelix.com/)

Additionally, here are some other obfuscators for Java that you could check out
for fun:
* [Allatori](http://www.allatori.com/)
* [DashO](https://www.preemptive.com/products/dasho/overview)
* [JBCO](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/JBCO/)
* [JObf](https://github.com/superblaubeere27/obfuscator)
* [NeonObf](https://github.com/MoofMonkey/NeonObf)
* [Obzcure](https://obzcu.re/) -
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/fUCPxq8) (Dev is away for a few months)
* [Sandmark](http://sandmark.cs.arizona.edu)
