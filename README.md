# Radon Java Obfuscator
## This is GravitLauncher launchserver module to obfuscate resulting Launcher with it.
* Configure on you own as normal Radon. In/Out and libs are specified automatically...
* Config is located in config dir in folder corresponding module name after first execute of build command (after module being installed)...
* I am not responsible for any consequences of using this module, and most importantly - for errors caused by it. Yes, you can report issues, but they are unlikely to be fixed (although there are exceptions).
* Also do not report issues from this fork to ItzSomebody before you have checked issue on original version of Radon...

## Info from author...
## Radon 2.0 will no longer be maintained - it will be replaced by Radon 3.0

Radon is a Java bytecode obfuscator that I conceptualized in my freshman year
of high school. I use Radon to experiment with obfuscation and to learn various
parts of Java bytecode.

Check the [wiki for usage](https://github.com/ItzSomebody/Radon/wiki) or maybe
even the [Discord](https://discord.gg/RfuxTea).

This project is **not** likely to be production-safe nor bug free. If you would
like some pointers to production-safe (more or less) and less buggy Java
bytecode obfuscators, I would suggest one of these:
* [Paramorphism](https://paramorphism.serenity.enterprises/) -
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/k9DPvEy)
* [Proguard](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/proguard)
* [Zelix KlassMaster](http://www.zelix.com/)

Additionally, here are some other obfuscators for Java that you could check out
for fun:
